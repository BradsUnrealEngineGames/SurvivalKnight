# SurvivalKnight

This is an executable copy of my third game with Unreal Engine, Survival Knight. The game was useful for teaching me about landscape creation and animation in Unreal 4. Feel free to give the game a try! Future changes may include differentiating the look of the protagonist from that of the enemies and balancing the combat to make the experience more challenging. Here are some sample pictures of the game.
